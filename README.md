To remove branches locally 
git branch -d branchName          //Safe delete, checks for unmerged changes
git branch -D branchName          //Force delete, ignores unmerged changes

To remove branches remotely  
git push origin --delete branch_name 

And to cleanup the reference to the branch in my local repo after deleting it remotely to keep sync with the remote
git fetch --prune

I created secret file called .env and ignored it in gitignore by just adding its name
and it wont appear in git status as untracked files
and if i accidentally committed it i use:
    git rm --cached .env  Untracks but keeps the file locally
    git commit -m "Remove secrets"
